# Chess API
This API does one thing only: it takes a chess game and returns the best next move. This project will grow, but for now it is intended to be a REST API to interface with the Stockfish chess engine.

### Getting Started
1. First, ensure Stockfish is installed globally on your machine.
2. Install python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `uvicorn app:app --reload` to run the project.

### Running with Docker
There will be a Dockerfile with instructions at a later time.
